# Requirements
The application must show the solar system interactive with planets moving in their respective orbit. Details about the object must be shown when hovering the object with the mouse or selecting them with mouse or touch. The planets must be in the right place of their orbit on every given time and the time is selectable/scrollable. The details of the object come from the api and are stored in the database. The database is updated every day at 00:00 with data from an open API.
